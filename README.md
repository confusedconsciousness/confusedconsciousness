### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Greetings fellow coding comrades! My name is Kishan Kumar, and I'm just your average Electrical Engineering graduate with a minor in Computer Science and Engineering from IIT Roorkee (no big deal, right?).

When I'm not busy coding away, I love to ponder the mysteries of the cosmos and have some mind-bending discussions on topics like Dark Energy, Black Holes, and whether we're all just characters in a cosmic simulation. It's probably not the most practical way to spend my time, but hey, I'm a dreamer.

I'm always looking for ways to use my skills for good, whether it's by contributing to social causes or just helping out a fellow coder in need. And when I'm not saving the world one line of code at a time, I'm always up for a light chit chat with like-minded individuals who share my love for both coding and the mysteries of the universe.

So if you're looking for a coding buddy who's equal parts humble, humorous, and intellectually curious, let's connect on Github and see where our shared interests take us. Who knows, maybe we'll even solve the mysteries of the universe together. Or, you know, just write some cool code.
