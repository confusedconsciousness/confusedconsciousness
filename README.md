### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Hello, my name is Kishan Kumar, and I'm a Software Engineer with 4 years of experience at PhonePe, a fintech company, where I've had the opportunity to work on several impactful projects. One of my most notable contributions is the development of Gatekeeper, a project that I built from the ground up and successfully took to production. Gatekeeper plays a critical role in our organization, streamlining the onboarding of new services and APIs onto our API Gateway.

Another key achievement was implementing a Dynamic Reloading system for around 500 instances of our API Gateway, which handles approximately 1 million requests per second. This solution eliminated the need for regular restarts, significantly reducing downtime and operational impact. The dynamic reloading was made feasible by Gatekeeper's robust sanity checks, ensuring safe and accurate configuration updates.

Additionally, I've optimized our infrastructure by reducing the number of API internal (used for S2S communication) instances from 150 to 20, a significant 86.67% reduction in resources, by focusing on delegating IO-intensive tasks to worker threads. This optimization has significantly decreased wait times for standard requests, enhancing overall system efficiency.

Regarding my education, I have completed my B.Tech from the Indian Institute of Technology, Roorkee, where I was honored with the best B.Tech project award for my work on a Smart Navigation system designed to assist visually impaired individuals.

Outside of work, I have a deep appreciation for art and music. I enjoy reading books on Cosmos, Philosophy, and sometimes fiction.
